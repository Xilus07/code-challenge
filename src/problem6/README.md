### Project Usage
1. Open draw.io via website (https://app.diagrams.net/) or via Application if installed in your local machine.
2. Click File > Open, and navigate to the file to select 'Problem 6.drawio'.
3. Diagram should now be visible.

### Additional Comments for Improvement
1. There are two diagrams in the file: One is when WebSocket is not implemented and the other where WebSocket is implemented.
2. This can be further improved if there is another scenario where it combines the idea of the two Diagrams; This is where when the database is updated instead of via API which will not be read by WebSocket unless a human intervention (User API Update) occured.
